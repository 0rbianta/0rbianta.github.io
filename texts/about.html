	<h1>About me, 0rbianta...</h1>
  <hr/>
	<p>
		Yes my name is 0rbianta and I would like to write my own story here but
		Nobody knows my story, it shouldn't. Why should I give information about myself with people I don't know on the internet?
		This promise I said must have given some impression of myself. I am a super-stealthy person who has been involved in hacking in the past.
		I don't care much about privacy right now, but it's still a habit. I mean by hackers fucking money thefts or morals
		not their crimes. I was a hacker with a white hat. I stopped hacking because I realized that over the years it hasn't given me any gain or success in life.
		Do not look at me as a hacker right now. I am disgusted with many hackers right now. Especially those who steal money and spoil privacy.
		I am currently writing software on various platforms such as Android, Linux, Web, PS4. Sometimes I write open source and sometimes it is taken against reverse engineering
		I write my code super-hiding using crazy security. Why are you reading this article? Have you ever asked yourself this question? Why are you here?
		You read because you are one of those people who are a curious and intelligent being who can read. You make me happy because I love people, what I do
		Use. Thanks for reading. Also, I can't go without saying that I have a love for freedom right now. Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!
