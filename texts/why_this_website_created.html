	<h1>Why this website created?</h1>
  <hr/>
	<h3>
	Anyone interested in software often needs to share something, and I needed a platform to publish some of my literary stuff.
	Today, I have devoted a few hours to this site and created such a site with the help I received from the internet and my own designs. It is an honor to share articles with you. With love, 0rbianta.
	This site uses a theme called XPeace and I own this theme. I am the copyright owner too. This project is open source and is subject to some rights.
