	<h1>How to be an honorable person?</h1>
  <hr/>
	<h3>
	Rule number one is to be a little smart. I'm not calling you a genius. Have you ever looked at monkeys before? It's hard to be proud if you're like them. Still, if you're smart enough to be an asshole, you might as well be honorable. The second rule of Honor is family and environmental decency. Is your family decent? Do you throw things on the floor knowing your neighbor is underneath you? This is about family decency.
Let's say your family is not so civilized and your environment is full of criminals. First, get away from there. If necessary, go to a country where the rules apply. Yeah, I can't help but tell you. But remember, it's all over with you. The first step to honor is to read. How good were your classes? Did you do your homework regularly? Did your teacher yell at you all the time? If possible, correct your lessons and keep them well. The second step of being honorable is to have at least 4 hobbies. These can be things like computers, music, sports, human relationships, foreign languages, maths or Lego that will increase your level of civilization, improve your brain. The third step is a civilized environment. Man is like Man. If you are in a disgusting environment where you look behind the girls on the road and you look at an environment that sells the product at unfair prices, you can be neither human nor honorable nor civilized. The fourth step is suffering. That's a good thing for me to do. I think pain makes a person human. It could be death, love, family problems, fights. Don't take this as if I'm asking you to commit a crime. Pain allows you to regenerate. You suffer and you work. You cry, but you never cry again. The fifth step, which is the last step, is to be sociable and happy. How can you talk to other people if you can't be happy? Can you deal with other people? Can you be honest with other people? I can almost hear what you're saying. You're saying I'm not social. Stop saying that because you think you're different from others. All people are the same, but only some have different education and background. Some like a lot of friends, some like a small environment. I couldn't get along with people a few years ago either. I struggled to understand what kind of beings they were, and I saw with my own eyes that they were all the same. I'm like you. Your friends are the same. Your whole circle is the same. Maybe some of them are hiding too well. Anyway. If you follow my five steps, you will be civil, human and honorable, because you love people and you love yourself.
