	<h1>Why hackers hacks people?</h1>
	<h3>And why they have to stop hacking?</h3>
  <hr/>
	<h3>
Do you know how it feels to be trapped and unhoused. It is very painful. You hear grudges. When features see someone doing what you want, you might feel like beating them. Meanwhile, there is a way for those who love technology and want to take revenge on it. Hack. They hack because they feel strong, they hack because they forget their injustice, they hack because they are happy. Then this happiness ends in 1 hour and they are the same as before. Does this remind you of anything? This is actually nothing but false happiness. Hackers say, I want freedom. But they try to do this in bad ways. Also, hackers are very keen on money and can be a little lazy. Instead of practicing and making money, they may be fraudulent. This is not true for all hackers. Some of them have high moral values ​​and respect for themselves. I also knew such hackers. I respect them too, because they deserve respect. Those who use hacking well generally do hacker as a hobby. So hacking is a tool for some people and a source of entertainment for others. As someone who has lived in this life, I can tell those stingy hackers that hacking in this life will not protect them, nor will it make them cool. Also, money does not matter in this life. Didn't you, the black hat hacker reading this, realize that by hacking, money can be earned more easily than hacker, and hacker will put you back as it will not bring you any gain? In general, according to my 4 years of experience, hacking has not worked for me and has hurt me. I can't help but say that all of your hacker friends, your girlfriends you have acquired in these ways, your mood, your view of yourself above everyone else are all fake and you will lose them all. You will be very unhappy. You'll cry. If you are reading these, if you are a malicious hacker, please stop hacking. I know this is addictive, but it is much better for the sake of you and your neighborhood and even your country, cafes, workplaces, factories, companies.
