	<h1>How programs cracking?</h1>
  <hr/>
	<h3>
	The answer is a little simple and a little bit difficult. First of all, I would like to say that I will not teach program cracking in this article. Programs can be reverse engineered and cracked like Lucky Patcher quickly or slowly. Let's say you made a program. How can you protect it? In fact, it is said that there is no escape from reverse engineering. They're right because the program needs to have code somewhere to work, but the code can be scrambled or encrypted. It can even be uploaded to a remote server. Personally, when I want to protect my programs from reverse engineering, I use ProGuard offered by Android Studio, I put my valuable code into a C file as a string, (They become so file later.) I print it out and have it checked that the items are in place. I do real-time encryption protection. (There are utilities as this is difficult to write manually.) Real-time encryption encrypts codes and strings. I shuffle DEX files. The person or software doing reverse engineering engages with multiple DEXs and needs to open them all. These are the reverse engineering protections that can be taken for Android. Apart from that, I recommend you to write in C language and present them by compiling for different processors because C language is a reverse engineering language in my opinion.
